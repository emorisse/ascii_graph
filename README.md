# ideas on how you can help
* Take a look at my bounds checking, I'm often off by 1 in indicie assignment.
* I don't bucket horizontally, so if you have more inputs than your terminal width, this is going to be ugly
* How to format the vertical axis labels. Eg, if there's a wide spread in digits in the labels, eg 0 vs 1,000,000, rounding and spacing between the labels and the \* won't line up the same
